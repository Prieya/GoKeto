                    <p>
                        My journey to keto this year was due to work travels that lead me to 
                        overeat, stress and drink alcohol. The early part of the year really 
                        threw me off my nutrition and workout regiments. I decided upon my 
                        return stateside to start back on a standard ketogenic diet and went 
                        all on day one! I haven‚Äôt looked back since. I‚Äôve maintained roughly 
                        10% body fat since about August with relative ease despite 
                        increasing my caloric intake (a calorie is NOT just a calorie). The 
                        ketogenic lifestyle does not limit my ability to eat out. My health 
                        goals are to remain at this physical level of leanness and to sustain 
                        it long term. Also to have my body and mind perform at peak levels as 
                        a result of this lifestyle.

                        On the left was January 3rd just after the Xmas Holidays and all the
                        endless food feasts! The right is yesterday 15th of February! I have
                        never done this since started working out and wow it's such a
                        motivational kick! Makes me really proud to see that I've set a goal
                        and managed to stick to it ! even more so mentally than the
                        physically! I have always struggled with procrastination and
                        perseverance so this was going to be my chance to prove to myself
                        that I could beat this self sabotaging loop I often get stuck into.
                        If someone would have told me last year that I'd be super into a
                        fitness challenge and enjoying a 6 weeks of daily workout I would've
                        laughed for days!! I didn't do any sort of physical exercise in the
                        past 16 years, being lazy, weak, smoking.. And here I am at the end
                        of these 42 sweaty days telling myself : YOU DID IT!!

                        I started working out around March 2020 when lockdown first began
                        and was doing a mix of YouTube workouts and going to the gym when it
                        was open. Then in October 2020 I ditched my gym membership
                        completely and have been doing Youtube workouts pretty much every
                        day since. I used to go to the gym about 4-5 days a week but never
                        really saw any progress. I wasn't gaining weight but I wasn't seeing
                        any difference in my body either. I did gymnastics all throughout my
                        childhood/most of my teenage years and was always very toned as a
                        result. After stopping gymnastics, my stomach became one of my
                        biggest insecurities; all I wanted was my gymnast abs back! Luckily
                        for me, I was wrong! After discovering Youtube workouts I'm slowly
                        getting back to be being as strong and as fit as I've ever been.

                        When I look at this photo I don‚Äôt just see a physical transformation
                        that pleases me, but a mental one too. I am both physically and
                        mentally stronger in the one on the right, my attitude towards food
                        is so much better now and my outlook of what fitness is has changed
                        greatly. I used to measure progress purely on the number I saw on
                        the scale but since joining the Doctor Lean, I‚Äôve started to take
                        note on how I feel as a measure of progress. I do a combination of
                        weightlifting and Youtube videos (mainly weightlifting) 6 days a
                        week and I actually enjoy it?! The me on the left (2020) would never
                        have thought I‚Äôd be this committed to myself and have such a
                        positive outlook on fitness and nutrition. I make sure that every
                        day, even on rest days (especially on rest days!) that I give myself
                        enough protein, enough carbs etc that my body needs to not just
                        function, but thrive. And as a result, my mind and soul thrives.

                        I‚Äôd just opened my own practice and was trying to make ends meet
                        while also going through a tough breakup, Then my father passed away
                        from cancer. Through it all, I self-medicated with food, ballooning
                        up to 228 pounds. My dad death was a wake up call, I found a new
                        purpose.I started lifting weights with a ‚Äúbro split‚Äù [body-part
                        training] five to six days a week. I started by eating most of the
                        same foods, but limiting carbs. About six weeks in, I was down 10
                        pounds.I started doing compound lifts at the beginning of each body
                        part. I also cut back on cardio and revamped my diet to include more
                        lean meats, Greek yogurt, avocados, and carbs from sweet potatoes
                        and whole grains. I was doing cardio six days a week after lifting,
                        which is too much. Now I keep it to three, max. My bench press went
                        up from 185 to 275 for 4‚Äì6 reps. I can squat 275 for four. And here
                        I am at my strongest.
