            left was January 3rd just after the Xmas Holidays and all the
            endless food feasts! Right is yesterday 15th of February! I have
            never done this since started working out and wow it's such a
            motivational kick! Makes me really proud to see that I've set a goal
            and managed to stick to it ! even more so mentally than the
            physically! I have always struggled with procrastination and
            perseverance so this was going to be my chance to prove to myself
            that I could beat this self sabotaging loop I often get stuck into.
            If someone would have told me last year that I'd be super into a
            fitness challenge and enjoying a 6 weeks of daily workout I would've
            laughed for days!! I didn't do any sort of physical exercise in the
            past 16 years, being lazy, weak, smoking.. And here I am at the end
            of these 42 sweaty days telling myself : YOU DID IT!!

            I started working out around March 2020 when lockdown first began
            and was doing a mix of YouTube workouts and going to the gym when it
            was open. Then in October 2020 I ditched my gym membership
            completely and have been doing Youtube workouts pretty much every
            day since. I used to go to the gym about 4-5 days a week but never
            really saw any progress. I wasn't gaining weight but I wasn't seeing
            any difference in my body either. I did gymnastics all throughout my
            childhood/most of my teenage years and was always very toned as a
            result. After stopping gymnastics, my stomach became one of my
            biggest insecurities; all I wanted was my gymnast abs back! Luckily
            for me, I was wrong! After discovering Youtube workouts I'm slowly
            getting back to be being as strong and as fit as I've ever been.

            When I look at this photo I don’t just see a physical transformation
            that pleases me, but a mental one too. I am both physically and
            mentally stronger in the one on the right, my attitude towards food
            is so much better now and my outlook of what fitness is has changed
            greatly. I used to measure progress purely on the number I saw on
            the scale but since joining the Doctor Lean, I’ve started to take
            note on how I feel as a measure of progress. I do a combination of
            weightlifting and Youtube videos (mainly weightlifting) 6 days a
            week and I actually enjoy it?! The me on the left (2020) would never
            have thought I’d be this committed to myself and have such a
            positive outlook on fitness and nutrition. I make sure that every
            day, even on rest days (especially on rest days!) that I give myself
            enough protein, enough carbs etc that my body needs to not just
            function, but thrive. And as a result, my mind and soul thrives.

            I’d just opened my own practice and was trying to make ends meet
            while also going through a tough breakup, Then my father passed away
            from cancer. Through it all, I self-medicated with food, ballooning
            up to 228 pounds. My dad death was a wake up call, I found a new
            purpose.I started lifting weights with a “bro split” [body-part
            training] five to six days a week. I started by eating most of the
            same foods, but limiting carbs. About six weeks in, I was down 10
            pounds.I started doing compound lifts at the beginning of each body
            part. I also cut back on cardio and revamped my diet to include more
            lean meats, Greek yogurt, avocados, and carbs from sweet potatoes
            and whole grains. I was doing cardio six days a week after lifting,
            which is too much. Now I keep it to three, max. My bench press went
            up from 185 to 275 for 4–6 reps. I can squat 275 for four. And here
            I am at my strongest.
